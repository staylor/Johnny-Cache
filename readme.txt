== Description ==

*This is a beta release. If anything breaks, SORRY! Drop me a note to report a bug.*

Provides an admin interface for inspecting Memcached instances and flushing items by key or group in an AJAX fashion. This should be considered a pre-release beta be-super-careful-when-using-type release.

I'll be updating this plugin a lot soon.

== Installation ==
Activate the plugin.

You MUST install the PECL Memcached extension and have Ryan's Memcached WP Object Cache plugin installed for this work / not throw fatal errors everywhere - I'll make this smoother later.

== Changelog ==

= 0.3 =
* Modernized some code

= 0.1 =
* Initial release
